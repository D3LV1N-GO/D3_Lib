I'll tell you a little about my addition to GoreBox modding.
For now there are only a couple of commands, in the future I'm going to add to them and update them.<h1>Base</h1><nobr>
</nobr>Access to commands from the library is done using the print command.
For example, if I want to get the time set on the PC, I should write:
<pre><code>
print("D3_RealDate")
</code></pre>
The response from this command will come to the OnChatMessage function.
Different commands will have different senders, but the message variable will always contain the data you wanted to receive.
<h1>Data work</h1>To work with data dll have 2 commands<ul><li>D3_SaveData</li><li>D3_GetData</li>
</ul>These two commands do exactly the same as described earlier. They call OnChatMessage with parameters<ul><li>sender= "D3_GetData"</li><li>message = YourData.</li></ul>
Reading occurs in the format:
<pre><code>Key{YourData}</code></pre>
If you want to save data, use command <pre><code>print("D3_SaveData Player{Data})</code></pre>You don't have to use { to save something, but it's better to always use them, it will be much more convenient to access your data in the future.
The role of the separator is played by '{' I think in the future it will be possible to change it in the config. Be careful!
Before you start working, you should set your path to GoreBox\D3_LibData\config.cfg. In the future, the config will have more parameters.
<h1>Real Date</h1>The easiest command to use. There is nothing complicated here, it just reads the time from your PC and then sends everything to the OnChatMessage function.
The sender variable is D3_RealDate. The message variable is the time from your PC.
